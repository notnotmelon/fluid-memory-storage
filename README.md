### Packed units
Q: What happens when a unit is broken? Are my fluids lost?

A: Fluids are not lost. Fluids are "packed" inside the item and are recovered when you place the unit back down.

Warning: If a fluid unit is destroyed (biters, nuke, or otherwise) then you will NOT get a packed unit and your items will be lost!

### Power
The fluid unit requires power to function!
The power usage is equal to:
1MW + (ceil(fluid amount / 1000) ^ 0.35) * 300kW
This can be changed in mod settings

If it runs out of power, then it will not accept any more fluids until it gets power again.

### Circuits
Memory units can connect to the circuit network! Simply attach a red or green wire to the circle on the top of the container.
This will read both the type and amount of whatever you have stored in the unit.

Circuit signals in Factorio can only go up to 2147483647. If you happen to have more items than this stored in a memory unit, then the signal will still only display as 2.1G.

### UPS
This mod is optimized. Should have a very minor impact on your UPS.

### Graphics
The color of the unit is based on the fluid inside!
